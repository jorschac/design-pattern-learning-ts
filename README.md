# design-pattern-learning-ts
Java like design pattern implements BY TypeScript.

Most of examples are created by myself and some have production significance. 

## Design patterns:

* adapter
* command
* decorator
* facade
* factory
* observer
* singleton
* strategy
* Undone yet ...

## How to Run the example code

```
$ npm install
$ npm run PatternNameAbove
$ node ./build/main.js
```

*NOTE:* Under most circumstances it is `main.js`. You can specify other js file to run if no `main.js` in `build` dir.
